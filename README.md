# Utilization

The usage of two separate plotting libraries necessitates independent download, setup, and installation by users.

* matplotlib (python)
* numpy      (pyhon)
*Scipy       (python)
# Example usage

* matplotlib (python)

The python files`maxfunction.py` can be run from the terminal by typing:

This requires a working `Python` distribution (so that the python executable exists) with the Python package `numpy`, `scipy` and `Matplotlib` also installed.
